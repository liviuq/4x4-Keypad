This is an integration of a 4x4 keypad matrix-style with Arduino.
For the hardware part, I used the NANO and 8 jumper wires.
For the software, I used the Keypad library ( made by Mark Stanley, Alexander Brevig)

How it works:
You have to set up the master password( the one with wich you unlock whatever you want)
and it simply checks if the entred string( by the user) is the same with the master.

Future updates will be published as time passes.
